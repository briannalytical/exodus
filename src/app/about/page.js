                            <p>We&#39;ve all heard it ad nauseam. You express whatever degree of
                            dissatisfaction with American life, and someone with advice you didn&#39;t
                            ask for suggests for you to leave. You can&#39;t help but wonder if the
                            people that toss these words around understand the process for leaving
                            the United States for any length of time. American is a very geographically
                            isolated country, and one third of Americans will die having never stepped foot
                            outside of American soil. So much for the good advice.</p>
